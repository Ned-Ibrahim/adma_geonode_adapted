"""One place that answers "may this user read or write this object?".

Anything that is not on the ADAPT share keeps ADMA's own rule: the owner may,
the public may read, nobody else.

ADAPT is different. ADMA mounts the share with one account that can read all of
it, so the share's own permissions do not reach ADMA users. Access comes from
FolderGrant rows that an administrator manages, each naming a folder by its
path on the share (see filemanager.adapt_share):

- A grant on a folder covers that folder, its files and everything beneath it.
- A user with a grant somewhere below a folder may open that folder to navigate
  down, but sees only the branches that lead to their grants and none of the
  files beside them.
- No grant, no access. ADAPT rows ignore is_public and ownership: they belong to
  the sync account or the uploader, and older rows were created public.
- Superusers see everything.

Paths compare without case, as on the share. The *_path functions answer for a
path; can_read, can_write and can_list_files answer for a Folder or File row and
look ADAPT rows up by the path they record.
