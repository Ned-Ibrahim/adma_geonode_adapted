"""The snr18 permission export, and what Windows makes of it.

snr18 exports the ACL of every ADAPT folder that has entries of its own or
blocks inheritance, one row per entry:

    "Path","Protected","Identity","Rights","Type","AppliesTo"
    "Flux Measurements","True","NEAD\\12345678","FullControl","Allow","ContainerInherit, ObjectInherit/None"

Path is relative to the ADAPT root, "(root)" is the root itself and "\\"
separates folders. Protected=True means the folder does not inherit from its
parent. AppliesTo is the inheritance flags and the propagation flags, joined
by "/". An optional IsInherited column marks entries a folder only inherited;
they are dropped, since the folder they come from carries them explicitly.

Everything here is plain Python over the export. adapt_acl check uses it to
work out what snr18 allows independently of filemanager.permissions, so it
must never read FolderGrant or the permissions module.
